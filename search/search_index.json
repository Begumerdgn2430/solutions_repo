Motion in One Dimension Consider motion along the x-axis with constant acceleration \\(a\\) . From the definition of acceleration: \\[ a = \\frac{dv}{dt} \\] Integrating both sides with respect to time: \\[ \\int a \\, dt = \\int \\frac{dv}{dt} \\, dt \\Rightarrow at + C_1 = v(t) \\] Letting \\(v_0\\) be the initial velocity at \\(t = 0\\) , we find \\(C_1 = v_0\\) , so: \\[ v(t) = v_0 + at \\] Now, velocity is the derivative of position: \\[ v = \\frac{dx}{dt} \\] Integrating again: \\[ \\int v \\, dt = \\int (v_0 + at) \\, dt = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 + C_2 \\] Letting \\(x_0\\) be the initial position at \\(t = 0\\) , we find \\(C_2 = x_0\\) , giving the position function: \\[ x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 \\] 2. General Solution in Two Dimensions We now extend the solution to two-dimensional motion with constant acceleration. Let \\(\\vec{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))\\) , \\(\\vec{v}(t) = (v_x(t), v_y(t))\\) , and \\(\\vec{a} = (a_x, a_y)\\) . Using the same integration steps for each component: Velocity components: \\[ v_x(t) = v_{0x} + a_x t \\] \\[ v_y(t) = v_{0y} + a_y t \\] Position components: \\[ x(t) = x_0 + v_{0x} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_x t^2 \\] \\[ y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 \\] Thus, the general vector solution is: \\[ \\vec{r}(t) = \\vec{r}_0 + \\vec{v}_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{a} t^2 \\] where: \\(\\vec{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0)\\) is the initial position, \\(\\vec{v}_0 = (v_{0x}, v_{0y})\\) is the initial velocity, \\(\\vec{a} = (a_x, a_y)\\) is the constant acceleration. This equation describes the position of a particle under constant acceleration in two-dimensional space. 2. Theoretical Foundation \ud83e\uddee Velocity Components: Horizontal: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta)\\) Vertical: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\) \u23f1\ufe0f Time of Flight: \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] \ud83d\udccf Range: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Maximum range occurs at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) Doubling \\(v_0\\) quadruples the range 3. Graphical Analysis \ud83d\udcca Plot 1: Range vs Angle for Different Velocities This graph shows how the range changes with angle for \\(v_0 = 10, 20, 30 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) . All curves peak at \\(45^\\circ\\) , confirming it as the optimal launch angle. \ud83d\udcca Plot 2: Range vs Angle on Different Planets Here, \\(v_0 = 20 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) and we compare projectile ranges on Earth , Moon , and Mars . The lower the gravity, the longer the projectile stays in the air, resulting in greater range. \ud83d\udcca Plot 3: Trajectories from Different Initial Heights This graph uses a fixed angle ( \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) ) and velocity ( \\(v_0 = 20\\, \\text{m/s}\\) ), but launches the projectile from various heights ( \\(h = 0, 5, 10\\, \\text{m}\\) ). As expected, higher launch points result in longer range and higher peak. \ud83d\udcca Plot 4: Trajectories at Multiple Angles Here we show the paths of projectiles launched at the same speed ( \\(v_0 = 20\\, \\text{m/s}\\) ) but with different angles: \\(15^\\circ\\) , \\(39^\\circ\\) , \\(45^\\circ\\) , \\(60^\\circ\\) , and \\(75^\\circ\\) . It visually demonstrates how lower angles have flatter paths and shorter airtime. \ud83d\udcca Plot 5: With vs Without Air Resistance This comparison plot shows the difference in trajectories when air resistance is considered. While real drag modeling is complex, we simulate a simplified scenario showing that air resistance reduces both range and peak height. 4. Insights and Applications 45\u00b0 is the optimal angle for range under ideal (no air) conditions. Air resistance significantly shortens the range and reduces height. Different planets yield different results due to varying gravity. Initial height adds more airtime and therefore greater range. These concepts are important in: - Sports physics (kicking, throwing) - Military ballistics - Spacecraft launches - Engineering simulations 5. Conclusion With physics equations and computational tools, we effectively analyzed how a projectile behaves under various scenarios.

This simple yet profound relationship allows for the determination of planetary motions and has implications for understanding gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. By analyzing this relationship, one can connect fundamental principles of gravity with real-world phenomena such as satellite orbits and planetary systems. Task 1. Derive the Relationship To derive the relationship between the square of the orbital period ( \\( T^2 \\) ) and the cube of the orbital radius ( \\( r^3 \\) ) for circular orbits, start with the balance of forces. The gravitational force on an orbiting body of mass \\( m \\) around a central mass \\( M \\) is: \\[ F = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] The centripetal force required for circular motion at velocity \\( v \\) is: \\[ F = m \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Equating these forces, we get the following aligned equations: \\[ \\begin{align} \\frac{G M m}{r^2} &= m \\frac{v^2}{r} \\\\ \\frac{G M}{r} &= v^2 \\\\ v &= \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} \\end{align} \\] The orbital period \\( T \\) is the time to complete one orbit, so the circumference \\( 2\\pi r \\) divided by the velocity \\( v \\) : \\[ \\begin{align} T &= \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} \\\\ &= \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}} \\\\ &= 2\\pi r \\sqrt{\\frac{r}{G M}} \\\\ &= 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G M}} \\end{align} \\] Square both sides to obtain: \\[ \\begin{align} T^2 &= \\left(2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G M}}\\right)^2 \\\\ &= (2\\pi)^2 \\frac{r^3}{G M} \\\\ &= \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\end{align} \\] Thus, \\( T^2 \\propto r^3 \\) , and plotting \\( T^2 \\) vs. \\( r^3 \\) should yield a straight line with slope \\( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} \\) . Note that ChatGPT's mention of an error in showing the line as straight is incorrect; the derivation confirms the relationship is linear. 2. Discuss the Implications Kepler's Third Law allows us to calculate planetary masses and distances: - Mass of the central body : By measuring \\( T \\) and \\( r \\) of an orbiting body (e.g., a moon or planet), we can determine \\( M \\) of the central body (e.g., a planet or star). - Orbital radius : If \\( M \\) is known, we can determine \\( r \\) from \\( T \\) , useful for satellites or exoplanets. - Period prediction : Knowing \\( r \\) , we can predict \\( T \\) , aiding in mission planning for spacecraft. 3. Analyze Real-World Examples Using data from Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, we verify the relationship.
